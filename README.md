TacTicTotal is a game similar to TicTacToe, but the game utilises arithmetic. The idea of the game is to help learners develop fluency in basic arithmetic with a deeper layer of developing stretigcal and tactical thinking, thus improving engagement on the road to fluency in mental arithmetic.

We initially had many stages of the game and made many modifications as a result of testing previous versions and encoutering "mathematical flaws".

We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJS, TypeScript and Taquito for the game and multiplayer capability online.
