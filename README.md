TacTicTotal is a game similar to TicTacToe, but the game utilises arithmetic. The idea of the game is to help learners develop fluency in basic arithmetic with a deeper layer of developing stretigcal and tactical thinking, thus improving engagement on the road to fluency in mental arithmetic.

Players take turns using the numbers 1 to 9 (once) to fill the grid. Player 1's objective is to make a line of three numbers with a sum of 16 whilst stopping player 2 from making 16. Player 2's objective is to try and make 15 whilst stopping player 1 from making 16.

We used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, NextJS, TypeScript and Taquito for the game and multiplayer capability online.
